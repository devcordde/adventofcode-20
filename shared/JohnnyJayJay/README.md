# JohnnyJayJay's solutions



## How to run them

1. Install a C compiler (preferably `cc`/`gcc`). For Windows users, I recommend using  [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

2. Compile from project root using `cc -Wall -g shared/JohnnyJayJay/aoc.c Day-XX/c/JohnnyJayJay/DayXX.c -o solution` 

3. Run with a path to your input file as an argument, e.g. `./solution shared/JohnnyJayJay/inputs/Day-XX.txt`

4. **These input files need to have LF line endings. Many of my solutions do not work with CRLF!** You can use a tool like `dos2unix` to convert them if you're unsure.
